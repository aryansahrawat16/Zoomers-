Zoomers! - June 12, 2024.
The purpose of my project is to create a race car game based off a concept of a 100m track running game that was called “Sprinter” that I used to play as a little kid. I strive to create a fun, enjoyable, and hard game for all that gives them the same experience I had as a little kid.
My goal is to have a story mode, a mult-player mode, and a practice track done all the end.
